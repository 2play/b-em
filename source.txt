                                 Version 0.7
                         A freeware BBC Micro emulator

Source code
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use the source code as reference for writing your own emulator,
that's fine. If you want to steal the odd function from it, that's fine too.
If you want to use large sections (such as the 6502 emulation, for example),
then email me. If you are kind and want to improve B-em, then by all means go
ahead. BUT, you can't just modify a few bits and distribute it under a
different name (or the same name), and if you do use bits out of it, you must
acknowledge the fact that I wrote it.

To compile B-em, you will need :

DJGPP 2
GCC
Allegro 4 (3 might work as well)
GZip

If you want to compile for Win32 instead, use Ming/W instead of DJGPP.

You will need to compile all the C files, and link them with Allegro and GZip.
