B-em v0.82
==========

Source for the DOS, Windows and OS X versions are included. The DOS and OSX
versions should/may also compile under Linux/QNX/BeOS, although I haven't
tried this. The Windows version uses a lot of platform-specific code, and will
not compile on other platforms.
The DOS and Windows versions will not compile under GCC 4 as I have this bad
habit of declaring variables in multiple source files instead of using header
files properly. The OS X version has been corrected and does compile.

For the DOS version, you will need :
DJGPP
Allegro
Zlib
2xSaI (modified Allegro version)

For the Windows version, you will need :
Ming/W
Allegro
Zlib
2xSaI (modified Allegro version)

For the OS X version you need :
Xcode
Allegro
Zlib

Just compile and link all the C files with the above libraries.
