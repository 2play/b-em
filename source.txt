B-em v0.8
=========

Source for both the DOS and Windows versions are included. The DOS version
should/may also compile under Linux/MacOS/QNX/BeOS, although I haven't tried
this.

For the DOS version, you will need :
DJGPP
Allegro
Zlib
2xSaI (modified Allegro version)

For the Windows version, you will need :
Ming/W
Allegro
Zlib
2xSaI (modified Allegro version)

Just compile and link all the C files with the above libraries.
