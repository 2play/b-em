                                 Version 0.3a
                                 Source code

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

B-Em is an attempt to emulate a BBC Micro, made by Acorn Computers in the 80's
This is the source code.

This is the second source release of 0.3a, as the first release was missing
the gfx.h file, and had much worse documentation.

If you want to use the source code as reference for writing your own emulator,
that's fine. If you want to steal the odd function from it, that's fine too.
If you want to use large sections (such as the 6502 emulation, for example),
then email me. If you are kind and want to improve B-em, then by all means go
ahead. BUT, you can't just modify a few bits and distribute it under a
different name (or the same name), and if you do use bits out of it, you must
acknowledge the fact that I wrote it.

Also note that some of the code was taken from Beebem, as it was the only
emulator source code I had at the time, and I had very few docs.

If you do want to contribute to B-em, then there is a list of stuff that needs
doing at the bottom of this file.


What's needed to compile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

B-em was written using DJGPP 2.02, GCC 2.81, and BNU 2.81. If you have a
similar distribution, then everything should compile.


What files are what
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

6502.*     - 6502 emulation core (don't compile!)
6850.*     - 6850 ACIA core
8271.*     - i8271 disc controller
adc.*      - Analogue to digital converter
bem.c      - B-em main file (includes 6502.c)
disk.*     - TFS
mem.*      - Memory core
scan2bbc.h - PC to BBC scancode table
serial.*   - Serial ULA emulation
snapshot.* - Snapshot handling
sound.*    - Sound emulation
uef.*      - UEF file handling
vias.*     - VIA emulation
video.*    - Video emulation

There is also setup.c, which is the setup program. The file makeall.bat will
compile everything. The files gfx.a and gfx.h are the graphics library, you
can use this for anything you want.


Stuff which needs doing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Can anyone help me with any of this?

Speed up the 6502 emulation
Speed up the video emulation
Fix the 6850 emulation
Fix some bugs in the 6522 emulation
Sort out sound emulation
Get bem.c to compile with optimisation
Neaten up the source code (no chance!)
