16/10/99 - Started work on 6502 emulation
24/10/99 - Gave up for a while because it doesn't work
20/5/00  - Rewrote the 6502 emulation (it was very badly written anyway).
           Still doesn't work
22/7/00  - Added some mode 7 emulation. Now boots (but that's about it)
24/7/00  - Got the keyboard working. Discovered that most of BASIC didn't work
Version 0.0 finalised

26/7/00  - Added cursor and true mode 7 emulation (instead of assuming things)
27/7/00  - Added a bit of colour to mode 7 (not correct colours though - still
           many control characters missing)
5/8/00   - Fixed BRK emulation, so error messages now work. Discovered that
           BASIC doesn't really work because almost everything you type is
           treated as a Syntax error. Tested a couple of programs; the
           introduction to Cybertron works, but Arcadians and Magic Mushrooms
           crash. No loaded BASIC programs work though
6/8/00   - Corrected mode 7 colours. Teletext graphics added, though not
           correct yet. Tested more games - the instructions on Frenzy work.
           Added generic .inf loader
8/8/00   - Added mode 2 emulation
9/8/00   - Added modes 1+5
10/8/00  - Wrote primitive FS (by trapping the OS). Only loading and *RUNing
           work
20/8/00  - Added error messages to the FS, instead of dumping back to DOS
22/8/00  - First version of *CAT added. Relies on files.lst file
27/8/00  - Fixed bug in setczvn (still not perfect though). Loads more BASIC
           now works, but it broke Chuckie Egg :(
28/8/00  - Added cursor to Modes 1+5
29/8/00  - Fixed shift and control keys.
30/8/00  - Tweaked Mode 2 emulation. Frenzy & Jet-Pac almost work. Added GUI
3/9/00   - Fixed bug in *LOAD, *RUN etc. Killer Gorilla & Blagger run more
Version 0.1 finalised

6/9/00   - Increased VIA delay, HUGE speedup but VIA accuracy falls apart.
7/9/00   - Randomized User VIA Port B (&FE60) - Snapper starts now (still
           unplayable). Added snapshots
8/9/00   - Model A emulation added.
9/9/00   - More accurate cycle count.
25/9/00  - Went back to fixed cycle count, as most programs run better with it.
1/10/00  - Started sound hardware emulation (no sound output though)
2/10/00  - Added command line options for model A/B emulation, sound log,
           fixed cycles, etc. Now save sound output to sound.pcm (very out of
           tune though)
4/10/00  - Changed 76489->samples algorithim, sounds slightly better.
           Hardwired joystick to no buttons pressed, Bumble Bee now works
5/10/00  - Added periodic noise to sound code.
8/10/00  - Added -fixed1 switch, 6502 goes bloody fast but VIAs slow down.
           Rewrote a lot of the System VIA code - must've fixed a timer bug,
           because the emulator is about 200% faster
10/10/00 - Logfiles now disassemble 6502 code. Added 1 bpp modes (0,3,4 & 6)
12/10/00 - Set System VIA initial latches to 0xffff on reset - loads more
           games run. Patched some weird OS System VIA routine in an attempt
           to get Magic Mushrooms to work.
13/10/00 - Rewrote most of 6502 ADC+SBC instructions. Most of BASIC now works (!)
           and the game compatibility has gone up loads
14/10/00 - Started work on 8271 FDC emulation. Can now boot up with Watford
           DFS (v1.10)
Version 0.2 finalised

15/10/00 - 8271 FDC emulation. Emulates :
                - a single, single sided, 80 track disc drive
                - a subset of the 8271 FDC commands
                - boots and works with Acorn & Watford DFSs
           Repton 3 now works, except for scrolling bugs
16/10/00 - Scrolling bug now fixed - now using System VIA hardware scrolling
           regs as well as CRTC ones. Added ANC instruction, Repton 2 now
           works. Removed bug that crashed the BBC every minute or so by
           removing the flashing colours. Added option to supply the DIP
           switches. Mode 0 now displays the whole width of the screen (if in
           640x400 or higher)
17/10/00 - Finally sorted out vsync interrupt, so more games (and flashing
           colours) now work. Added Xbeeb __CATALOG__ support for tape filing
           system
18/10/00 - Started 6850 ACIA emulation (although all my code spells it ACAI..)
19/10/00 - First attempt at sampled tape emulation. Doesn't work.
20/10/00 - Added support for double sided discs
21/10/00 - Scanline drawing added (-scanline) in an attempt to get Revs
           working (Revs still doesn't work, but Rocket Raid now looks better).
22/10/00 - First attempt at sound output. Sounds horrible.
23/10/00 - Added seperated Teletext graphics.
27/10/00 - Inlined some more 6502 instructions in an attempt to increase the
           emulator's speed, since it didn't speed it up I suspect there's a
           VIA timer bug or two somewhere. Played about with the user VIA
           polling code, got Firetrack and Starquake to work.
28/10/00 - Started printer emulation. Forgot to make SBC BCD affect P, now
           fixed (Zalaga and Planetoids now work). Added SAX+ASR instructions
           for Zalaga.
30/10/00 - Fixed bugs in ADC+SBC BCD. Reptons 1+2 now play music. Added LAX,
           RLA, and all NOPs, Android Attack now works. Sound output improved.
31/10/00 - Worked on noise generator (a bit better). Added some more 6502
           instructions.
1/11/00  - RRA,DCP,SRE & SBX instructions implemented, ie instructions 0-&4F
           and &A0-&FF implemented. Still not added, ARR, SHA, SHX, SHY, SHS,
           some SAX, and HALT instructions.
2/11/00  - Did some more optimisations - converted most `static inline's to
           #defines - you can now compile bem.c with optimisation again. Added
           the rest of the undocumented instructions, all instructions
           emulated (hopefully...).
3/11/00  - More accurate cycle times. Added patch to get Frak! to work.
4/11/00  - Improved cycles times. Started Tube emulation again.
5/11/00  - Abandoned Tube emulation.
7/11/00  - Added a few instructions I missed out.
29/11/00 - Removed 6502 debugging info, significant speed increase.
30/11/00 - Optimised video routines, BBC now runs at almost 6mhz in mode 2 on
           a PII-350.
13/12/00 - Fixed a couple of 6502 bugs (nothing fixed though).
14/12/00 - Fixed BRK bug - error messages now work properly.
21/12/00 - Added frameskip, and cleaned up code a bit.
21/1/01  - Got a copy of the Advanced User Guide.
24/1/01  - Fixed a few VIA bugs, increased compatibility.
31/3/01  - Added UEF support, changed video modes. Improved setup program.
Version 0.3 finalised and released
10/4/01  - Removed the `clear screen' command, moved everything into seperate directories,
           improved UEF support a little, and added American BBC support.
Version 0.3a finalised and released

12/10/01 - Changed graphics library to Allegro, and ported over the SN76489
           emulation from YAAME. Sound is really good now, but the keyboard is
           broken.
14/10/01 - Keyboard now fixed by using older version of Allegro (someone
           changed the scancodes). I must update the keytable before release.
12/12/01 - Changed timing method, so the 6502 emulation executes a scanline,
           then updates everything. Used different method for colour selection
           (everything uses the mode 2 table), except modes 1+5 didn't like
           the change and broke.
13/12/01 - Attempted to fix broken modes, failed.
14/12/01 - Misc optimisations.
15/12/01 - Fixed the bug in modes 1 and 5 (a variable was signed instead of
           unsigned). Put a real font in mode 7.
16/12/01 - Fixed up mode 7 emulation (really good now). Fixed scanline
           emulation so the emulated CRTC generates 312 lines instead of 304.
           Went back to newer version of Allegro - must redo keytable.
17/12/01 - Redid keytable - working now. Fixed some misc bugs.
31/12/01 - Rewrote BCD maths. SBC now seems to work fine, but ADC is a bit
01/01/02   fucked. Whoever wrote the BCD maths routines in 64doc.txt got it
           completely wrong.
02/01/02 - Added simple GUI.
04/01/02 - Improvements to GUI. Monochrome mode added
12/01/02 - More improvements to GUI. Serial code completely removed. Did
           compatibility test.
Version 0.4 finalised and released.
14/01/02 - Found microphone and sampled disc drive.
15/01/02 - Disc drive noise added.
19/01/02 - Fixed a few bugs, Exile and Star Swarm work fine now. Re-added
           model A emulation. Invented .sn file format, wrote player, and
           added logging.
Version 0.4a finalised and released.
